TERMS OF USE

Pelles C is freeware for any use: personal, commercial, etc. No registration is
required to download it, and you can use it anonymously. Pelles C can be freely
distributed, but it can not be sold. Pelles C is provided 'as-is', without any
expressed or implied warranty. In no event will the author be held liable for
any damages arising from the use of this software.

Pelles C is totally free. However, some users may want to express their
gratitude by donating some money. If Pelles C is a major part in building a
product sold for money, it seems fair (to me) to donate a little bit of that
money to Pelles C - but this is never required.

Donations will help to pay for this website, my time spent on support, and any
possible new versions.
